# Papworth Corpus

This is a work-in-progress organization of the blazons in Papworth's Ordinary of British Armorials.

The project is organized as follows:

- `/bin`: contains various developer scripts
- `/corpus`: contains the transcribed corpus
  - Each file corresponds to one page in the original document. The files are TSV files of two fields: `<blazon><tab><meta>`
- `/resources`: contains PDFs and text versions of the original document

The PDF is retrieved from archive.org:
