CROSS 

From  old  blasons  it  might  be  inferred  that  a 
cross  moline  was  originally  a  pierced  cross 
sarcelly ;  but  as  later  writers  have  used  the 
terms  sarcelly  or  recercily  for  voided  through- 
out,  and  sometimes  for  fimbriated,  and  even 
for  cotised,  the  following  entries  are  made  in 
accordance  with  the  original  blasons,  and  where 
the  coats  have  been  tricked  the  present  no- 
menclature  has  been  Hdopted;  the  same  system 
has  been  adopted  where  flory  or  patty  have 
been  used  for  patonce.
