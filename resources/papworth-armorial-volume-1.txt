PREFACE. 


In  consequence  of  the  decease  of  Mr.  Papworth  in  July  1870,  after  a  painful 
illness  of  several  years'  duration,  it  was  found  that  this  Work  could  not  be 
completed  according  to  the  original  scheme  of  publication,  and  the  Subscrip- 
tion list  was  therefore  finally  closed. 

As,  however,  there  was  a  general  desire  among  the  Subscribers  that  the 
Work  should  be  completed,  the  continuation  of  it  was  entrusted  to  Mr. 
Papworth's  relative  and  friend,  Mr.  Alfred  W.  Morant,  whose  qualifications 
for  this  undertaking  were  not  unknown  to  some  of  them.  It  may  therefore 
be  sufficient  to  mention  here  that  his  taste  for  such  subjects  had  led  him 
to  take  a  friendly  interest  in  this  Work  almost  from  its  commencement,  and 
to  watch  and  further  its  progress;  and  he  had,  in  the  course  of  his  own 
heraldic  pursuits,  arranged  a  large  collection  of  foreign  coats  of  arms  on  a 
similar  plan,  and  compiled  several  other  manuscripts  on  this  and  kindred 
subjects. 

It  was  at  that  time  ascertained  that  at  least  three-fifths  of  the  manuscript 
had  been  published  in  the  696  printed  pages  ;  and  the  remaining  two-fifths  of 
it  were  left  by  Mr.  Papworth  sufficiently  arranged  for  reference.  Mr. 
Morant,  besides  the  necessary  and  laborious  technical  revision  of  the  press 
from  p.  696,  has  had  to  insert  in  their  proper  places  the  remainder  of  the 
coats  contained  in  the  several  Eolls  referred  to  under  the  letters  A  to  Z, 
copies  of  which  Mr.  Papworth  had  prepared  for  the  purpose :  and  also  to 
arrange  and  enter  numerous  additional  coats  collected  in  the  course  of  many 
years  by  Mr.  Papworth.  Mr.  Morant  has  likewise  added  the  coats  of  some 
new  creations,  together  with  a  number  of  others  from  his  own  collections. 
The  manuscript  also  required  the  necessary  preparation  for  the  press,  and 
in  parts  some  rewriting  to  adapt  them  to  the  author's  final  plan  as  carried 
out  in  type.  This  plan  has  been  adhered  to  throughout  the  remainder  of  the 
Work,  mainly  through  the  kind  assistance  of  Mr.  Weston  Styleman  Walford, 
whose  appreciation  of  it  in  the  first  instance  is  noticed  in  the  Introduc- 
tion. He  has  kindly  supplied  many  special  details  connected  with  the 
arrangement  of  the  coats,  and  his  willingness  in  affording  advice  has  been 
extended  to  the  Editor  and  to  Mr.  Wyatt  Papworth,  thus  ensuring,  it  is 
hoped,  the  same  degree  of  accuracy  in  their  revision  as  was  attained  by  the 
author.  Only  the  revision  of  the  type,  and  the  matters  connected  with  the 
publication  were  undertaken  by  Mr.  Wyatt  Papworth. 

The  unpublished  portion  contained  very  few  references  to  the  authority  W 
(Withie's  additions  to  Glover's  Ordinary,  contained  in  a  copy  in  the  British 
Museum) ;  an  omission  considered  not  important. 


viii  PREFACE. 

It  has  been  thought  advisable  to  reprint  Mr.  Papworth's  original  Introduc- 
tion, with  such  alterations  only  as  were  deemed  necessary,  rather  than  to  insert 
an  elaborate  essay  by  another  hand. 

Many  inquiries  having  been  made  whether  an  Index  of  Names  was  to  be 
supplied,  it  may  be  well  to  record  that  Mr.  Papworth  had  no  such  inten- 
tion. This  Dictionary  of  Coats  of  Arms  having  been  originally  founded  on  the 
Encyclopaedia  of  Heraldry  published  by  Sir  Bernard  Burke,  which  comprises 
a  Dictionary  of  Armorials  wherein  the  Names  are  given  alphabetically  followed 
by  the  several  coats  of  arms,  the  two  works  will  doubtless  be  much  used 
together,  especially  as  the  latter  is  to  a  great  extent  an  Index  to  the  former. 
The  additional  entries  from  the  Eolls  and  other  sources  into  this  Dictionary, 
although  numerous,  hardly  appeared  to  need  an  Index  to  themselves,  many 
of  the  names  being  merely  variations  in  the  spelling  of  those  to  be  found  in 
the  Encyclopaedia. 

The  two  Tables  which  will  be  found  at  pp.  xvii  and  xix  have  been  inserted 
in  order  to  facilitate  the  use  of  the  Work. 

A  List  of  the  Subscribers  to  the  Work,  under  the  final  arrangement 
that  was  made  for  completing  it,  is  appended,  together  with  the  number 
of  copies  which  their  payments  entitled  them  to  receive.  As  antici- 
pated in  the  scheme  for  continuing  the  publication,  the  balance  then  in  hand, 
though  somewhat  increased  under  that  arrangement,  has  been  found  insuf- 
ficient to  defray  the  expenses.  The  sale  of  the  remaining  copies  will  pro- 
bably repay  Mr.  Wyatt  Papworth  the  amount  advanced  by  him  for  the  pur- 
pose of  completing  the  publication,  and  may,  it  is  hoped,  eventually  yield  some 
remuneration  for  the  great  labor  and  time  expended  by  his  late  brother  in  the 
preparation  of  the  manuscript,  and  in  the  collection  of  the  material.  The 
assistance,  however,  of  the  Subscribers  in  extending  a  knowledge  of  the  Work 
is  earnestly  requested. 

Additional  Title-Pages  have  been  furnished  for  the  convenience  of  those 
who  may  be  desirous  of  binding  the  Work  in  two  volumes. 

Mr.  Wyatt  Papworth  has  only  to  add  his  thanks  to  the  Subscribers  for 
their  patience  during  the  long,  and  at  last  fatal,  illness  of  his  brother,  which 
tended  so  much  to  retard  the  progress  of  this  publication ;  and  for  their 
support  of  the  scheme  proposed  by  him  for  the  completion  of  the  Work  now 
happily  achieved.

INTRODUCTION 


The  object  of  this  Work  is  to  enable  the  generality  of  persons,  though  but 
slightly  acquainted  with  heraldry,  to  ascertain  with  facility  the  names  of 
the  families  by  whom  any  given  coats  of  arms  are,  or  have  been,  borne.  For 
this  purpose  a  very  large  number  of  coats  have  been  for  the  first  time  arranged 
in  alphabetical  order,  so  that  any  of  them  may  be  readily  found ;  and  the 
names  of  the  respective  families  are  attached: 

The  Plan  of  the  Work  is  simply  this :  the  arms  are  blasoned  {i.e.,  techni- 
cally described),  and  are  arranged  in  alphabetical  order  by  the  names  of  such  of 
the  respective  charges  as  are  first  mentioned  in  the  blason  ;  so  that  the  inquirer 
has  but  to  blason  the  coat,  and  the  first  charge  that  he  names  shows  under 
what  title  in  tins  Dictionary  the  coat  is  to  be  sought.  When  the*0,  is  no 
charge,  the  tincture  of  the  field  is  to  be  considered  as  the  charge,  and  such  a 
coat  will  be  found  under  the  head  of  that  metal,  color,  or  fur.  Again ;  when 
there  is  no  charge,  if  the  field  be  party,  the  ordinary  employed  to  designate 
the  direction  of  the  partition  gives  the  place  of  a  coat  of  this  kind  in  the 
alphabet;  thus,  for  example,  per  bend  will  be  found  under  bend.  In  like 
manner,  when  there  is  no  charge,  coats  that  are  harry,  bendy,  gyronny,  paly, 
etc.,  will  be  found  respectively  under  bar,  bend,  gyron,  pale,  etc.  Coats 
which  are  billety,  crusily,  or  otherwise  semy,  follow  a  similar  rule ;  for  if  there 
be  no  other  charge,  those  of  which  the  field  is  semy  are  regarded  as  charges ; 
but  they  are  considered  as  parts  of  the  field  when  there  is  another  charge* 

In  a  few  cases,  the  different  modes  of  blasoning  of  which  arms  are  capable 
may  make  it  necessary  to  refer  to  more  than  one  title. 

Some  of  the  charges,  such  as  the  ordinaries  and  others  much  in  use,  form 
heads  so  comprehensive,  that  several  divisions  and  subdivisions  became  indis- 
pensable :  there  it  will  be  seen  that  further  alphabetical  arrangements  have 
been  observed ;  sometimes  by  the  tinctures  only,  and  sometimes  by  the  charges 

*  This,  it  will  be  observed,  is  confined  to  the  field  ;  on  the  contrary,  charges  which  are 

billety,  crnsily,  etc.,  are  regarded  as  surcharged.

X  INTRODUCTION. 

also.  This  part  of  the  Plan  will  be  best  learned  by  inspection  ;  for  it  is  hardly- 
possible  to  express  it  precisely  in  a  few  words.  It  may,  however,  be  stated, 
that  when  the  coat  has  only  one  charge,  or  charges  of  one  kind,  the  second 
alphabet  is  by  the  tinctures ;  but  in  more  complicated  cases  there  is  an 
alphabet  of  those  charges  or  surcharges  which  fall  under  that  part  of  any 
division  or  subdivision,  ivhich  makes  it  to  differ  from  a  preceding  one ;  and  as 
often  as  such  a  charge  is  a  chief,  quarter,  canton,  or  base  which  is  surcharged, 
there  is  a  further  alphabet  of  these  surcharges ;  and  in  every  case  there  is 
finally  an  alphabetical  arrangement  of  the  coats  by  the  tinctures.  It  will  be 
observed  that  under  some  subdivisions  the  coats  appear  to  be  not  in  alpha- 
betical order  by  their  tinctures.  It  will,  however,  be  found  that  they  are 
arranged  in  groups  according  to  some  of  the  charges  named  in  the  blason ; 
and  that  each  group  has  the  coats  in  it  alphabetically  arranged  by  their 
tinctures.  A  new  group  begins  as  often  as  a  variation  either  in  kind  or 
in  number  occurs  in  the  charges.  The  apparent  irregularity  is  due  to  the 
absence  of  headings  to  the  several  groups.  All  beasts,  birds,  fishes,  flowers, 
fruits,  etc.,  though  specially  named,  come  together  in  their  respective  places, 
just  as  if  the  proper  headings,  according  to  this  Dictionary,  had  been 
inserted.  A?  ..  i,.  not  easy  without  practice  to  supply  those  headings 
mentally,  a  coal  may  often  be  more  readily  found  by  looking  at  once  for  the 
tincture  of  the  field ;  ibr^hese  subdivisions  rarely  contain  many  coats,  and  it 
$oes  not  in  general  take  much  time  to  run  the  eye  over  all  the  first  named 
tinctures 

It  will  be  seen  that  of  several  objects  constituting  a  charge  or  surcharge 
the  first  in  the  order  of  blason,  and  of  a  complicated  charge  or  surcharge  the 
â¢'â¢â >t  important  portion,  have  respectively  been  taken  for  the  alphabetical 
words. 

The  usual  marks  of  cadency,  when  employed  merely  as  modern  differences, 
are  not  to  be  regarded  as  charges  or  surcharges  for  any  of  the  above  purposes ; 
and  the  occasional  difference,  the  bordure,  is  not  to  be  relied  on  as  a  distinctive 
charge,  except  in  the  simpler  coats :  arms  within  one  may  often  be  found  in 
this  Work  where  they  would  have  been  if  there  had  been  no  bordure. 
Charges  over  all  form  no  element  of  subdivision. 

For  those  who  are  moderately  conversant  with  Heraldry  the  preceding 
explanation  might  suffice ;  but  to  render  the  Plan  more  intelligible  to  persons 
who  are  less  skilled  in  the  technical  description  of  arms,  and  to  assist  the 
memory  of  others,  such  of  the  rules  of  blason  as  are  applicable  to  the  sub- 
ject are  subjoined,  with  some  remarks  in  further  elucidation  of  the  method 
observed  in  this  Work. 

1.  The  tincture,  if  but  one,  of  the  field  is  first  to  be  noticed. 

2.  If  the  field  be  of  more  than  one  tincture,  the  partition  is  to  be  named 


INTRODUCTION.  xi 

with  any  peculiarity,  such  as  indented  or  the  like,  and  then  the  tinctures ;  as 

for  example,  parly  per  pale  indented  arg.  and  gu. 

The  word  party  is  generally  omitted  in  this  Work,  and  only  per  fess, 
per  pale,  etc.,  used  in  such  cases.  Instead  of  per  cross  the  term  quarterly, 
as  being  more  commonly  understood,  lias  been  employed ;  and  such  coats 
without  charges  are  to  be  found  under  that  head.  When  the  arms  in 
question  consist  of  two  or  more  coats  marshalled  quarterly,  they  are  to 
be  sought  separately.  The  arrangement  as  to  such  arms  as  are  harry, 
bendy,  paly,  etc.,  and  also  as  to  such  as  are  semy  as  regards  the  field,  has 
been  explained  above. 

3.  Next  comes  the  principal  ordinary  (not  being  a  chief)  or,  if  none,  the 
central  charge  (if  any)  on  the  field,  with  any  peculiarity  and  its  tincture ;  as 
arg.  a  chevron  engrailed  gu.,  or  arg.  a  lion  rampant  gu. 

4.  Then  should  follow  any  other  charges  on  the  field,  between  or  within 
which  such  ordinary  or  other  central  charge  is  placed,  as  arg.  a  chevron  betw. 
three  mullets  az. 

These  two  rules  have  been  carefully  observed ;  although  it  is  not 
unusual  to  say,  for  example,  arg.  between  two  cotices  an  anchor  gu.,  in 
this  Work  the  blason  is  arg.  an  anchor  between  two  cotices  gu.  In  like 
manner  a  "  bend  coticed",  is  a  "  bend  between  two  cotices".  The  other 
diminutives  have  been  treated  in  the  same  way;  and  a  "bar-gemel" 
is  reckoned  as  "  two  bars".  The  word  between  is  sometimes  omitted,  for 
brevity,  in  the  blason  of  such  coats  as  are  referred  to  in  rule  4,  when 
the  accompanying  charges  are  of  different  kinds  ;  as  for  example,  arg.  a 
fess  gu.  in  chief  two  mullets  az.  in  base  a  fleur-de-lis  vert. 

5.  If  the  principal  ordinary  or  other  central  charge  be  itself  charged,  then 
on  is  to  precede  it ;  but  the  surcharge  on  it  is  not  to  be  named  till  after  the 
other  charges  (if  any)  on  the  field,  between  or  within  which  such  ordinary  or 
other  central  charge  is  placed ;  as  arg.  on  a  chevron  between  three  mullets  gu.  an 
estoile  or. 

There  are,  however,  some  ill-devised  complicated  coats  of  modern 
date,  which,  to  avoid  obscurity,  are  generally  blasoned  by  naming  the 
surcharge  immediately  after  the  charge  on  which  it  is  placed.  There 
are  also  coats  of  earlier  date,  in  which  an  ordinary  is  surmounted  by 
another  of  the  same  land ;  these  are  sometimes  blasoned,  for  example, 
thus :  gu.  a  fess  or  surmounted  of  another  az.  between  three  crescents  arg. ; 
but  they  will  here  be  found  in  accordance  with  the  rule,  as  gu.  on  a  fess 
or  betw.  three  crescents  arg.  another  fess  az.  Marks  of  cadency  or  the  like 
used  as  differences  will  be  presently  mentioned. 

6.  If  there  be  no  central  charge,  the  charges  on  the  field  should  be  mentioned 
mediately  after  it,  as  they  may  be  placed,  regard  being  had  to  the  rules 
ich  follow  ;  as  arg.  three  mullets  gu.  two  and  one  (or  in  pale,  in  bend,  in  fess, 
the  like). 


xii  INTRODUCTION. 

Iu  describing  the  places  that  charges  occupy,  such  terms  as  in  chief, 
in  base,  between,  and  vrithin,  frequently  occur,  and  are  used  in  the  subdi- 
visions of  the  larger  heads  in  this  Dictionary.  There  are  other  terms 
hardly  less  common,  such  as  in  bend,  in  f ess,  in  pale,  etc.,  indicating  the 
relative  positions  of  charges  when  there  is  no  such  ordinary  in  the  coat ; 
but  the  arrangement  of  this  Work  does  not  in  any  way  depend  on  them. 

7.  Charges  in  chief  and  in  base  are  to  be  named  after  those  in  the  middle 
of  the  field ;  and  those  in  chief  before  those  in  base,  but  subject  to  the  next 
rule. 

In  general,  a  chief  is  not  understood  to  be  a  charge  in  chief ;  that 
ordinary  being  in  the  nature  of  an  addition  to  the  field.  But  for  the 
purpose  of  the  methodical  distribution  of  the  arms  under  the  more 
important  heads,  it  has  been  found  convenient  to  use  the  term  in  chief 
in  an  extended  sense,  and  to  comprise  under  it,  not  only  charges  properly 
so  designated  from  their  position,  but  also  a  chief  itself,  whether  sur- 
charged or  not.  It  is  essential  to  bear  this  in  mind,  and  also  that  in 
base  is  used  in  its  utmost  latitude. 

8.  A  chief,  quarter,  or  canton  with  its  surcharges  (if  any)  is  to  be  named 
after  the  charges  (if  any)  on  other  parts  of  the  escucheon. 

9.  All  charges  and  surcharges  inclosed  within  a  bordure  are  to  be  named 
before  it. 

When  a  bordure  is  the  sole  or  primary  charge,  the  coat  will  be  found 
under  that  head  in  the  Dictionary. 

10.  A  chief,  quarter,  or  canton  overlying  a  bordure  must  be  named  after  it. 

11.  In  like  manner,  any  charge  over  the  others,  or  as  it  is  termed  over  all, 
must  be  mentioned  after  them. 

When  one  ordinary  or  other  charge  is  on  the  field,  and  another  over 
all,  such  arms  are  often  to  be  found  represented  and  blasoned  differently  ; 
so  that  it  becomes  uncertain  which  is  the  primary  charge.  This  occurs 
occasionally  even  where  a  lion  or  other  beast  is  debruised  by  a  bar,  a 
bend,  or  the  like.  It  is  therefore  expedient,  when  there  is  a  charge 
over  all,  and  the  coat  cannot  be  found  under  what  appears  to  be  the 
primary  charge,  to  turn  to  that  which  overlies  it,  as  if  that  were  on  the 
field.  In  blasoning  such  coats  the  word  surmounted  should  be  avoided, 
as  it  may  lead  to  a  coat  of  this  kind  being  mistaken  for  a  surcharge  on 
a  charge  only. 

12.  The  marks  of  cadency,  when  used  as  modern  differences  to  distingui; 
younger  sons  and  junior  branches  of  families,  and  also  the  mark  of 
Baronetcy,  are  to  be  named  last. 

From  what  has  been  said  it  will  be  evident,  that  to  find  any  given  cc 
the  course  is  to  observe  the  charge  which  is  first  named  in  blasoning  it,  a 


INTRODUCTION.  Xlii 

to  turn  to  that  title  in  the  Dictionary.*  If  the  charge  be  of  a  kind  but  rarely 
used  as  a  primary  one,  it  will  form  a  head  which  is  divided  only  according  to 
the  number  of  them  borne  in  the  various  coats  in  which  it  so  occurs ;  and 
under  these  divisions  such  coats  follow  in  alphabetical  order  by  their 
tinctures :  so  that  if  the  coat  be  a  simple  one,  consisting  of  any  number  of 
charges  of  that  sort  only,  it  is  readily  found. 

Should  the  first  charge  be  one  of  more  frequent  occurrence,  as  for  example 
mullets,  then  instead  of  the  division  only  according  to  the  number  in  different 
coats,  there  will  be  found  divisions  according  to  the  manner  in  which  they 
are  borne  as  primary  charges  with  others  accompanying  them,  following  a 
method  of  distributing  the  various  coats  under  the  larger  heads,  which  is 
observed  throughout  this  Work ;  and  suppose  the  coat  in  question  to  be,  for 
example,  gu.  five  annulets  arcj.  a  canton  erm.,  then  under  the  division  "  five 
annulets  and  in  chief"  (for  a  canton  is  always  borne  in  chief),  follow  the  class 
of  coats  to  which  this  belongs,  in  alphabetical  order  by  the  names  of  the 
respective  charges  in  chief.  A  reference  to  the  Work  itself  will  furnish 
numerous  examples  of  such  cases,  and  of  others  analogous  to  them. 

The  principal  ordinaries  and  other  charges  of  most  common  occurrence 
form  such  comprehensive  heads,  that  the  divisions  and  subdivisions  under  each 
of  them  are  numerous ;  and  it  will  facilitate  the  use  of  this  Dictionary,  if  the 
Plan  of  it,  in  this  respect,  be  noticed  with  more  particularity,  as  it  extends 
more  or  less  to  all  the  important  charges.  It  is  obvious  that  if  a  charge 
occupy  the  centre,  or  indeed  any  other  part  of  the  field,  whatever  charge  or 
charges  accompany  it  must,  speaking  generally,  be  either  upon,  above,  or 
below,  or  on  one  or  more  sides  of  it,  that  is,  in  heraldic  language  on  it, 
in  chief,  in  base,  or  on  the  dexter  or  the  sinister  side ;  or  it  will  be  between 
or  within  them ;  or  it  may  be  within  a  bordure,  orle,  or  tressure.  The  cases 
of  the  dexter  and  the  sinister  side,  as  well  as  some  other  possible  ones,  may  be 
for  the  present  purpose  disregarded :  the  rest  enter  largely  into  the  method 
of  distributing  the  various  coats.  The  head  Pale,  for  example,  may  be  made 
to  show,  as  fully  as  any  other,  the  scheme  or  method  which  has  been  devised ; 
and  this  may  be  most  effectually  done  by  bringing  all  the  divisions  and  subdi- 
visions under  the  eye  at  once  in  a  tabular  form,  premising  only  that,  though 
they  are  chiefly  derived  from  the  various  conditions  in  which  a  Pale,  charged 
or  not,  or  palets  may  stand  in  relation  to  other  charges,  the  partition  of  the 
field  in  the  direction  of  a  pale  or  palewise  has  supplied  the  divisions

it  has  been  thought  best  to  retain  it,  though  the  coats  arranged  under  this  head  in  the  Work 
have  not  required  all  the  subdivisions  here  mentioned.

Under  each  of  the  above  divisions  and  subdivisions  follow  the  arms 
answering  to  it  in  alphabetical  order  by  the  charges  and  the  tinctures,  or  if  no 
charge,  according  to  the  tinctures  only.  The  mode  in  which  this  has  been 
accomplished  will  be  best  understood  from  an  inspection  of  some  of  the 
examples  given  under  the  head  Pale,  or  under  the  more  comprehensive  heads, 
Bend,  Chevron,  and  Pess.  More,  indeed,  will  be  learned  by  running  the  eye 
over  the  several  subordinate  headings  under  those  heads  than  could  be  com- 
municated by  any  description.  It  must  be  remembered  that  in  chief  compre- 
hends every  charge  there,  even  a  chief  itself.  Per  pale  and  paly  are  not 
subdivided ;  for,  as  has  been  explained,  when  there  are  charges  on  such  fields, 
these  coats  do  not  come  under  the  head  pale,  but  under  those  respectively  of 
the  several  primary  charges.  A  bordure  does  not  form  a  distinctive  charge  in 
the  above  arrangement,  except  where  the  word  within  occurs  :  some  coats  con- 
sisting of  a  primary  charge  and  one  in  chief  (or  in  base)  within  a  bordure  are ' 
placed  under  between  or  within  and  in  chief  (or  in  base,  if  such  is  the  case).  It 
will  be  observed  that  over  all  forms  no  subdivision ;  the  consequence  of  which 
is,  that  though  a  coat  with  a  pale  (for  example)  only  on  the  field  may  become 
comparatively  complex  by  reason  of  a  charge  over  all  being  itself  charged ; 
still  it  is  to  be  sought  under  a  pale,  and  so  in  analogous  cases.  Paly 
and  also  barry,  bendy,  etc.,  are  not  confined  to  even  numbers  of  the  pieces, 
because  in  early  heraldry  coats  occur,  intended  for  the  same,  which  have  the 
number  sometimes  even  and  sometimes  odd.  As  one  of  the  consequences  of 
the  diminutives  of  the  principal  ordinaries  not  being  distinguishable  inter  ke 
in  early  coats,  under  Bend  cotiees  will  be  found  as  bcndlcts. 


INTRODUCTION.  XV 

In  general,  the  terms  of  the  blason  point  out  very  clearly  under  what  divi- 
sion or  subdivision  a  coat  is  to  be  sought ;  but  occasionally  this  is  more  readily 
suggested  by  the  coat  itself  or  a  sketch  of  it.  Thus  a  pale  hillcty  falls  under 
on  A  pale,  since  "billety"  is  "charged  with  billets  exceeding  ten."  Again,  a 
pale  and  three  charges,  say  for  example  mullets,  whether  two  and  one  (the 
arrangement  when  nothing  more  is  said),  or  in  chief,  in  bend,  in  fess,  or  in 
base,  come  under  on  a  pale  between  ;  for  one  of  the  mullets  is  on  the  pale, 
and  that  is  between  the  two  others.  The  same  remark  is  applicable  to  such  a 
coat  as  per  fess  gu.  and  or  a  pale  counter  changed  and  three  eagles  displayed  of 
the  last.  The  pile  would  have  furnished  examples  similar  to  those  furnished 
by  the  pale.  Should  the  unskilled  inquirer  hesitate  by  reason  of  the  omission 
01  the  word  between  in  such  coats  as  arg.  a  fess  gu.  in  chief  two  mullets  az.  in 
base  a  feur-de-lis  vert,  a  glance  at  the  coat  as  tricked  (i.e.,  sketched)  will 
remove  all  difficulty. 

Those  that  have  had  but  little  experience  in  early  heraldic  examples,  to 
say  nothing  of  the  more  recent,  know  how  difficult  it  often  is  to  determine 
what  species  of  beast,  bird,  fish,  flower,  fruit,  monster,  reptile,  or  tree,  a  charge 
was  intended  to  represent.  This  has  led  to  all  kinds  being  brought  together 
under  the  respective  titles  of  beast,  bird,  fish,  flower,  fruit,  monster, 
reptile,  and  tree,  and  there  distinguished  by  their  several  special  names :  so 
that  different  species  may  be  sought  for  at  most  within  a  few  pages,  instead 
of  having  to  turn  to  several  remote  parts  of  the  volume.  Demi-animals  come 
under  the  same  head  as  the  entire  animals  of  the  same  kind,  and  have  pre- 
cedence of  them ;  so  that,  for  example,  demi-lions  come  before  lions.  With 
the  exception  of  demi-animals,  all  parts  of  animals,  including  those  of  the 
human  figure,  will  be  found  under  their  heraldic  designations ;  and  a  similar 
rule  has  been  applied  to  all  parts  of  vegetables.  Heads  comprise  not  only 
those  of  animals,  but  also  those  of  inanimate  objects,  as,  for  example,  spear- 
heads. Fleurs-de-lis  (not  being  lilies  proper  or  lis  of  the  garden)  are  not 
ranked  as  flowers,  but  as  fleurs-de-lis  ;  nor  are  cinquefoils,  which,  as  also 
foils  of  all  numbers,  are  to  be  sought  under  foils  ;  and  in  lieu  of  tre,  quatre, 
cinque,  etc.,  the  figures,  3,  4,  5,  etc.,  are  used  to  distinguish  the  several  kinds. 
Bezants,  etc.,  are  to  be  found  under  the  general  term  roundle  ;  and  several 
other  charges  which  it  seemed  expedient  to  class  under  general  heads  are 
arranged  under  such  heads. 

The  inconveniences  which  would  otherwise  have  arisen  from  such  classifi- 
cations are,  it  is  hoped,  obviated  to  a  great  extent  by  the  Table  which  is  given 
at  p.  xix,  showing  under  what  general  titles  in  the  several  alphabets  the 
various  species  of  classified  charges  are  to  be  sought,  when  this  does  not 
appear  above,  or  by  cross  references  in  the  Work  itself. 


XVI  INTRODUCTION. 

In  early  heraldry  there  are  some  charges  of  different  kinds  which  have  been 
often  confounded  and  variously  blasoned.  Thus  the  distinction  between  the 
diminutives  inter  se,  and  sometimes  between  them  and  the  principal  ordinary 
itself,  was  not  recognised ;  as,  for  example,  a  bendlet  and  a  cotice,  and  also  a 
bendlet  and  a  bend  (as  we  now  regard  them),  were  often  identical,  there  being 
no  rule  for  the  proportion  of  such  charges.  So  roses  and  cinquefoils  or  quatre- 
foils,  lozenges  and  fusils,  a  fess  indented  and  lozenges  or  fusils  in  fess,  a  fess 
indented  and  a  fess  engrailed,  masculy  and  lozengy,  vair  and  nebuly,  and  some 
others,  have  been  mistaken  for  each  other.  Such  causes  of  uncertainty  in  the 
charges  give  occasion  to  search  being  made  for  very  early  coats  under  different 
heads ;  which  is  an  inconvenience  no  classification  could  avoid. 

The  author's  idea  of  this  Work  was  not  altogether  new :  almost  simul- 
taneously with  his  completion  of  his  arrangement,  but  without  any  knowledge 
of  the  undertaking,  W.  S.  Walford,  Esq.,  F.S.A.,  advocated  in  the  Archaeo- 
logical Journal*  the  necessity  for  some  publication  of  the  kind.  That 
gentleman's  patient  investigation  of  the  Plan  of  the  proposed  Work  led  to  so 
favorable  an  estimate  of  it,  as  to  induce  him  to  promote  its  appearance,  not 
only  in  the  usual  manner,  but  also  by  giving  valuable  advice  whenever  the 
author  had  occasion  to  ask  his  assistance. 

The  author  always  deprecated  a  hasty  opinion  of  the  Work :  for  though, 
in  an  attempt  so  novel  and  so  laborious,  he  could  not  expect  to  produce  one 
that  was  faultless,  he  was  convinced  that  by  a  careful  examination  of  it,  many, 
if  not  all,  objections  that  may  occur  on  a  superficial  view  will  be  satisfactorily 
removed.
